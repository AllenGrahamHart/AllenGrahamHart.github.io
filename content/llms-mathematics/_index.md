I am very excited to be working on a project to assess the capabilities of AI agents to write entire pure and applied mathematics papers, including coming up with their own research questions.

Large Language Models have matched or exceeded human expert performance on economically valuable multi-hour tasks (GDPval), with task time horizons doubling every 7 months since 2019 (METR). The models have won gold medals in the mathematics, physics, and astrophysics olympiads (Deepmind, OpenAI) and have started solving conjectures encountered in research (Godel Test). Though very impressive, these competition problems and conjectures are self-contained `small world' (Sutton, Big World hypothesis) problems that can be completed in a few hours, in contrast to a full research program that could span months or years, involves selecting research questions, filtering information from millions of books and papers, and embedding the results into a coherent narrative. 

To assess the capabilities of AI on real research tasks we have built an agent that can autonously write entire pure and applied mathematics research papers, including coming up with its own research question. Our goal is to refine the agent further, and have its scientific output reviewed by domain experts across a variety of fields. This is an ongoing research project so that as the models improve we can measure the improvements of their scientific output.
