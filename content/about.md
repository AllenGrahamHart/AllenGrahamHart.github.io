## About Me

In May 2025 I started working as an Innovation Research Associate (InRA) at Warwick University, a role where I work on a wide range of exciting projects collaborating with academics and industry partners, including battery optimisation and efficient vector search. In my own research time I am working on forecasting the capabilities of AI to autonomously conduct pure and applied mathematics research. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Bath as part of the SAMBa CDT, which included a masters degree in statistics and applied mathematics. My research was into an esoteric recurrent neural network called a Reservoir Computer, which has random features and is trained with linear regression. Alongside my PhD research I collaborated with a COVID modelling group as part of the Rapid Assistance in Modelling the Pandemic (RAMP) team.

Since the PhD I interned at the tech start up PatchsHealth (previously Spectra) specialising in AI for healthcare applications, and worked as a research fellow at the University of Exeter on Project Bluebird. Bluebird is an ongoing collaboration between the University of Exeter, the Alan Turing institute, and NATS to automate air traffic control. Before the PhD I spent two summers at the nuclear facility l'Institute Laue Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble studying the diffraction of neutrons through ice and graphite surfaces.
